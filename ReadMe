  {
      "username": "new_user",
      "password": "password123"

### 6. Get All Users

- **Endpoint:**

  ```
  GET http://localhost:8080/users
  ```

- **Headers:**

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
  ```

- **Access Control:**

  - Requires **ADMIN** role.

---

### 7. Create User

- **Endpoint:**

  ```
  POST http://localhost:8080/users
  ```

- **Request Body (JSON):**

  ```json
  {
      "username": "new_user",
      "password": "$2a$10$5zLAAnaiquOUNhiKOxIjjeq5d.PYNuBQzwQV1S8Lra00JIdFC4zUu",
      "email": "new@example.com",
      "firstName": "New",
      "lastName": "User",
      "role": "USER"
  }
  ```

- **Notes:**
  - The password must be **hashed** before sending. The example uses a BCrypt hash for `"password123"`.
  - You can generate the hash using tools like [bcrypt-generator.com](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) or programmatically.


- **Headers:**

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
  ```

- **Access Control:**

  - Requires **ADMIN** role.
  - The password here can be in plain text; the system will handle hashing.
